# VSTS Tasks
Visual Studio Team Service build tasks for a variety of build, deploy, and utility functionality in your VSTS Build pipeline.

For more information on building and deployment see my blog post on ["Building Custom VSTS Build Tasks"](http://blog.travisgosselin.com/building-custom-vsts-build-tasks/)

See [Microsoft Dev Ops Tasks](https://github.com/Microsoft/vso-agent-tasks)  and also [Total ALM Tasks](https://github.com/TotalALM/VSTS-Tasks) for more tasks, examples and deployment instructions.
